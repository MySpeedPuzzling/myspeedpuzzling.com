# TODO

Open follow-ups, one place to come back to. Tick an item when it ships, delete a section when it is empty.
Feature-sized plans keep their own checklist in `docs/features/<feature>/` - this file is for the loose ends
that would otherwise be forgotten. Newest section on top.

## Getting started / newcomer onboarding

Shipped 2026-09-20 (`1f59d530`). Design, research and rules: [`features/getting-started-guide.md`](features/getting-started-guide.md).
Mirrored in [#212](https://github.com/MySpeedPuzzling/myspeedpuzzling.com/issues/212).

**Not built yet**

- [ ] First-time celebration: after the very first saved time, a small "Nice!" moment (reuse the picker's confetti) with
      links to *My statistics*, *Leaderboard* and *Finish my profile* - the best moment to introduce those features
- [ ] Empty states with one sentence + one button on the owner's own empty profile, collections and wishlist
      (only empty statistics has one today); link to the guide's anchors `#track`, `#library`
- [ ] Welcome e-mail with the same first steps + the guide link (today only the verification mail goes out)
- [ ] Edit profile: basic form (name, photo, country…) to the top, developer cards (tokens, applications) folded at the bottom
- [ ] `membership.full_description` is out of date: no Insights / picker filters, "coming soon" items that shipped

**Verify / decide**

- [ ] One real registration on production end to end: name → welcome screen → Hub card at "1 of 5" → guide, click
      *My statistics* and check the step gets its tick (the `mark-seen` beacon was never clicked in a real browser)
- [ ] Native-speaker read of the es / fr / de / ja texts (`onboarding.*`), Japanese first
- [ ] Should Statistics / Leaderboard ticks also count visits through the menu, not only a click from the guide?
      (costs a check on every view of those pages)
- [ ] Remove the NEW badges on "Getting started" and "Pairs & Teams" when they stop being new (no expiry built in)

**Measure**

- [ ] Compare activation (share of registrations with a solving time within 7 days) before vs after 2026-09-20 -
      SQL in the feature doc. If people stall at the fifth checklist step, drop "Add a favorite puzzler"
