    intro_block: |
        <p>Your feedback is very important to us and we appreciate it greatly! If you have anything you'd like to tell us, please write to us at <a href="mailto:simona@speedpuzzling.cz">simona@speedpuzzling.cz</a> (or at <a href="mailto:j.mikes@me.com">j.mikes@me.com</a> for technical matters) or on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/myspeedpuzzling/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>
        <p>All our source codes are open-source and public on <a href="https://github.com/MySpeedPuzzling">GitHub SpeedPuzzling</a>. We adhere to the philosophy of "sharing is caring" and strive to share everything about myspeedpuzzling.com openly.</p>

    question_fair_play: |
    answer_fair_play: |
        <h4 class="mb-3">How do you know I'm not cheating when entering times?</h4>
        <p>Honestly - we probably won't. In the public leaderboard, where puzzlers enter times themselves, we rely on the honesty and integrity of each individual puzzler. Would you really enjoy a dishonestly entered result?</p>
        <p>We assume that, like us, other puzzlers assemble primarily for the joy of it, and the times from this type of assembly are indicative for a rough idea of how we compare to others and will measure up during some competition. Tell me, wouldn't it look suspicious if I had a time of 20 minutes on the platform but took 3 hours during a competition?</p>
        <p>In the future, we also plan rated leagues, where time verification might be required, for example, through video recording.</p>
        <p class="text-danger mb-0"><small>Since our community includes finalists of the World Jigsaw Championship, who have placed at the top, we can take their times as reference. Suspicious times will be monitored and if fraud is proven, they will be mercilessly deleted. In case of repeated cheating, the player's access to the platform will be restricted.</small></p>

    question_qr: I received puzzles with a QR code and myspeedpuzzling.com logo, what should I do?
    answer_qr: |
        <p>To make assembling and entering times as pleasant as possible for you, we add a QR code to all puzzles that pass through our hands - scanning it takes you to the page with the given puzzles, where you can directly start timing or enter your time.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">If you'd like to help spread the word about speedpuzzling and add a flyer with a QR code to your puzzles, please write to us - we'll send you a PDF that you can print out, or we can mail you printed flyers directly.</p>

    question_add_time_for_missing_puzzle: Can I add time for puzzles not on the platform?
    answer_add_time_for_missing_puzzle: |
        <p>Definitely! If you've assembled a puzzle that isn't yet on our platform, when adding time, switch to the option:</p>
        <div class="form-check form-switch mb-3">
            <input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" id="switch-add-puzzle">
            <label class="form-check-label" for="switch-add-puzzle">Enter puzzle manually - unknown manufacturer or not in the list</label>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-0">Then you have the option to select from a list of manufacturers. If the manufacturer is also not in the database, you can enter it yourself.</p>

    question_edit_or_delete_time: How do I edit or delete an entered time?
    answer_edit_or_delete_time: |
        <p>In the <a href="%link%">My Profile</a> section, next to each entered time, you'll find a link to edit (the link looks like a pencil icon <span class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-dark px-2 py-1 border-0"><i class="ci-edit"></i></span>).</p>
        <p class="mb-0">On the editing page, at the very bottom, there's a <a class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-danger mx-2">magic button</a> that once and for all deletes the record from the entire internet.</p>

    question_button_start_solving: What does the <a class="btn btn-accent btn-sm mx-2"><i class="ci-time"></i> Start Solving</a> button do?
    answer_button_start_solving: |
        <p class="mb-0">Opens the stopwatch with selected puzzles - you can start assembling and timing right away.</p>

    question_button_add_my_time: What does the <a class="btn btn-accent btn-sm mx-2"><i class="ci-add"></i> Add My Time</a> button do?
    answer_button_add_my_time: |
        <p class="mb-0">Opens adding your time to selected puzzles - suitable if you use your own stopwatch and have just finished assembling. If you assembled in the past and want to record the time, you have the option to also specify the date you assembled.</p>

    question_helping: Do you want a helping hand?
    answer_helping: |
        <p class="mb-0">Sure! Connect with us, ideally with an idea of how you would like to get involved in building the speed puzzling community, we'll put our heads together and surely come up with something.</p>

        title: The Biggest Outage in the History of MySpeedPuzzling
        content: |
            <h2 class="h5">On February 17, we experienced the longest outage in the history of MySpeedPuzzling ...</h2>
            <h4 class="h6">First of all, I want to thank all of you so much for your patience and trust! Believe me, those 7 hours when we knew MSP wasn’t working were extremely stressful for us!</h4>
            <p>Today, we had an almost 10-hour outage of the entire platform. It is the longest outage in MySpeedPuzzling’s history. It wasn’t our fault... or was it?</p>
            <p>Because we strive to be 100% transparent, here’s a step-by-step account of what happened.</p>
            <p>I went to bed around 1:30 AM (unfortunately, just before everything went down), having just finished another new feature for MySpeedPuzzling. Around 5 AM, when one of our kids got up to use the bathroom, Simona automatically checked notifications on her phone—she often looks at who posted new times and how quickly they managed to solve the puzzle. Yes, even at 5 in the morning... But she was greeted by an unpleasant surprise: the page wouldn’t load. She nudged me, saying: “MySpeedPuzzling isn’t working!” Hearing that woke me up immediately. I grabbed my phone, tried it, and it really wasn’t working! I grabbed my laptop to examine things more closely. At 1:59 AM, we’d received an automated monitoring notification, which usually isn’t good news. Unfortunately, I missed it because I’d gone to bed just before. Besides, the change I’d made was in no way destructive and couldn’t have caused such an outage. And so began our Monday outage, which lasted almost until noon.</p>
            <h5>Technical details for geeks:</h5>
            <p><em>(this will give you a glimpse into our server infrastructure)</em></p>
            <p>A week ago, I installed a mail server on our physical MySpeedPuzzling server—this was preparation for migrating from Auth0 to our own authentication service, plus a newsletter and other features—sending tens of thousands of emails a month isn’t just a walk in the park, and we need to be ready for it. As it turned out, that mail server was indeed the culprit, but let’s not jump ahead.</p>
            <p>The first thing I discovered was that ports 443 and 80 were timing out. The server hosts multiple applications, and this affected all of them, not just MSP—which was unpleasant. Another, more troubling finding was that I couldn’t access the server via SSH—the port also timed out.</p>
            <p>What now? Panic set in, and I told Simona this was a big problem.</p>
            <p>I immediately notified the server provider that this particular server wasn’t responding—at that moment, it seemed like a clear problem on their end because the server didn’t respond at all, while other servers in the same data center were still reachable. I suspected a hardware issue, maybe a bad network card or a loose cable (this has happened to me before…), or a provider ban due to suspicious activity.</p>
            <p>The provider replied within a few minutes saying they weren’t seeing anything on their end. They checked the data center; the server was running and responding—from their perspective, everything was fine. Great, so they saw no issue, but the MSP server was still unreachable and I couldn’t log in…</p>
            <p>I quickly booted a rescue system alongside the server, from which I successfully mounted the MSP server’s filesystem, and began the needle-in-a-haystack search. I knew the outage happened around 1:58–1:59 AM. I looked for any files changed at that time, in case we’d been hacked. I found nothing. None of it made sense, and I couldn’t spot anything. Around 8:00 AM, a colleague from work joined me to help out. Together, we discovered that SMTP on port 25 (used for sending emails) was working and not timing out—I could even send myself an email, and it was actually delivered.</p>
            <p>That only confused us further—the server was running and operational, it was "only" unreachable, and ports 80 and 443 were also blocked. By then, we were almost certain there was some issue with the network configuration—everything still looked “normal,” but our prime suspect was the mail server!</p>
            <p>And indeed, that was the case. Everything on the server runs in Docker containers. Anyone who’s used Docker knows its networking can be tricky. The mail server I chose also includes fail2ban, which is designed to block access from suspicious IP addresses—for example, if there are too many failed login attempts or other threats. I’ll skip about two more hours of diagnosing—but essentially, fail2ban wasn’t configured properly (it was left in its default settings), and combined with UFW, it somehow mysteriously blocked all traffic on ports 22, 80, and 443—even though we still don’t fully understand why it happened that way.</p>
            <p>Once I knew the cause, the final fix didn’t take too long—quickly uninstall the mail server (including UFW), flush iptables, re-add the Docker networking rules, “bounce” everything a few times, disconnect the rescue system, restart everything, and… finally, after an agonizing five hours of cursing at the monitor, MSP was back to normal…</p>
            <p>I skipped some unnecessary details—like how I switched DNS to a CloudFlare proxy within five minutes in the meantime and set up a Node.js worker to display a message about the outage—just so there wouldn’t be a blank page…</p>
            <p>For now, I’m putting the mail server work aside, and I know it will be “off to the side,” on a separate server, away from MSP. On the one hand, it was interesting to test our “disaster recovery” process—at one point I was so desperate that I was ready to let this server burn in hell, spin everything up on a new one, and just update the DNS records… Luckily, that proved unnecessary in the end.</p>
            <p>PS. It really did break "on its own", thanks to the mail server, after a week without any human intervention… That’s quite something…</p>
            <p>PS2. You’re brave if you’ve read all the way through :-).</p>
