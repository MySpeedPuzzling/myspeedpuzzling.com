        <p>Your feedback is very important to us and we appreciate it greatly! If you have anything you'd like to tell us, please write to us at <a href="mailto:simona@speedpuzzling.cz">simona@speedpuzzling.cz</a> (or at <a href="mailto:j.mikes@me.com">j.mikes@me.com</a> for technical matters) or on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/myspeedpuzzling/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>
        <p>All our source codes are open-source and public on <a href="https://github.com/MySpeedPuzzling">GitHub SpeedPuzzling</a>. We adhere to the philosophy of "sharing is caring" and strive to share everything about myspeedpuzzling.com openly.</p>

    question_fair_play: |
    answer_fair_play: |
        <h4 class="mb-3">How do you know I'm not cheating when entering times?</h4>
        <p>Honestly - we probably won't. In the public leaderboard, where puzzlers enter times themselves, we rely on the honesty and integrity of each individual puzzler. Would you really enjoy a dishonestly entered result?</p>
        <p>We assume that, like us, other puzzlers assemble primarily for the joy of it, and the times from this type of assembly are indicative for a rough idea of how we compare to others and will measure up during some competition. Tell me, wouldn't it look suspicious if I had a time of 20 minutes on the platform but took 3 hours during a competition?</p>
        <p>In the future, we also plan rated leagues, where time verification might be required, for example, through video recording.</p>
        <p class="text-danger mb-0"><small>Since our community includes finalists of the World Jigsaw Championship, who have placed at the top, we can take their times as reference. Suspicious times will be monitored and if fraud is proven, they will be mercilessly deleted. In case of repeated cheating, the player's access to the platform will be restricted.</small></p>

    question_qr: I received puzzles with a QR code and myspeedpuzzling.com logo, what should I do?
    answer_qr: |
        <p>To make assembling and entering times as pleasant as possible for you, we add a QR code to all puzzles that pass through our hands - scanning it takes you to the page with the given puzzles, where you can directly start timing or enter your time.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">If you'd like to help spread the word about speedpuzzling and add a flyer with a QR code to your puzzles, please write to us - we'll send you a PDF that you can print out, or we can mail you printed flyers directly.</p>

    question_add_time_for_missing_puzzle: Can I add time for puzzles not on the platform?
    answer_add_time_for_missing_puzzle: |
        <p>Definitely! If you've assembled a puzzle that isn't yet on our platform, when adding time, switch to the option:</p>
        <div class="form-check form-switch mb-3">
            <input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" id="switch-add-puzzle">
            <label class="form-check-label" for="switch-add-puzzle">Enter puzzle manually - unknown manufacturer or not in the list</label>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-0">Then you have the option to select from a list of manufacturers. If the manufacturer is also not in the database, you can enter it yourself.</p>

    question_edit_or_delete_time: How do I edit or delete an entered time?
    answer_edit_or_delete_time: |
        <p>In the <a href="%link%">My Profile</a> section, next to each entered time, you'll find a link to edit (the link looks like a pencil icon <span class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-dark px-2 py-1 border-0"><i class="ci-edit"></i></span>).</p>
        <p class="mb-0">On the editing page, at the very bottom, there's a <a class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-danger mx-2">magic button</a> that once and for all deletes the record from the entire internet.</p>

    question_button_start_solving: What does the <a class="btn btn-accent btn-sm mx-2"><i class="ci-time"></i> Start Solving</a> button do?
    answer_button_start_solving: |
        <p class="mb-0">Opens the stopwatch with selected puzzles - you can start assembling and timing right away.</p>

    question_button_add_my_time: What does the <a class="btn btn-accent btn-sm mx-2"><i class="ci-add"></i> Add My Time</a> button do?
    answer_button_add_my_time: |
        <p class="mb-0">Opens adding your time to selected puzzles - suitable if you use your own stopwatch and have just finished assembling. If you assembled in the past and want to record the time, you have the option to also specify the date you assembled.</p>

    question_helping: Do you want a helping hand?
    answer_helping: |
        <p class="mb-0">Sure! Connect with us, ideally with an idea of how you would like to get involved in building the speed puzzling community, we'll put our heads together and surely come up with something.</p>

        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>These Terms of Service govern the provision of subscription (membership) on the MySpeedPuzzling.com platform. We want you to have all the important information in one place so you can easily review it.</p>
        <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Provider:</strong> Simona Mikešová (Sole Proprietor)</li>
            <li><strong>Address:</strong> Františka Formana 237/31, 700 30 Ostrava, Czech Republic</li>
            <li><strong>ID No.:</strong> 06868878</li>
            <li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:simona@speedpuzzling.cz">simona@speedpuzzling.cz</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>As the operator of the MySpeedPuzzling.com platform, we are your contractual partner for purchasing and using paid membership.</p>
        <h2>2. How the Service Works</h2>
        <p>MySpeedPuzzling.com is an online platform for jigsaw puzzle enthusiasts. We offer various features, while premium parts of the application are accessible only to users with an active membership.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Membership is a virtual (digital) product – once you pay, you immediately gain access to exclusive features.</li>
            <li>Since it is an electronic service, no physical delivery or shipping conditions apply.</li>
            <li>The content and features available as part of the membership may change over time – we are continuously improving them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3. Ordering and Conclusion of the Contract</h2>
        <p>If you decide to purchase a paid membership, simply choose the monthly subscription in the “Membership” section. You will then be redirected to the Stripe payment gateway.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Payment Details:</strong> All payment details are processed via Stripe using encrypted communication – we do not have access to this information.</li>
            <li><strong>Order Confirmation:</strong> The contract between you and us is concluded at the moment of successful payment. Your membership is immediately activated afterward.</li>
            <li><strong>Invoice:</strong> You can download the invoice for your paid subscription directly from the Stripe payment portal.</li>
            <li><strong>Further Membership Management:</strong> Changes to the payment method, cancellation, or extension are also managed through the Stripe payment portal, accessible via the “Membership” section in your account.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>4. Prices and Payment Terms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Membership Price:</strong> All prices are stated including VAT. Depending on the currency you use for payment, prices may vary slightly.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Methods:</strong> Stripe supports card payments, Apple Pay, and Link (other methods may be added over time).</li>
            <li><strong>Recurring Payment:</strong> This is a monthly subscription, which means the payment recurs each month until you cancel your membership.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>5. Cancellation and Refunds</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>You can cancel your membership at any time:</strong> After cancellation, you will retain access until the end of the prepaid period. No further payments will be taken once that period ends.</li>
            <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> If you request a refund for the current billing period, we will refund the payment using the same method you used to pay, and your membership will end immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Processing Speed:</strong> We process refunds and claims promptly (usually within the next business day), no later than within 30 days as required by law.</li>
            <li><strong>Refund Costs:</strong> We cover any fees for refunds – we want you to be satisfied.</li>
        </ul>
